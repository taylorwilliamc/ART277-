    We've heard it all since the pandemic started -- lemon juice kill the coronavirus, masks don't work,
    if you already had <a href="">COVID-19</a> you can't get it again or that the vaccines approved for
    emergency use will change your <abbr>DNA</abbr> or put a tracking device in your body.

    Wonderful new, right? Wonderful news, right?<br>

        going to shed vaccine components and alter the <abbr>DNA</abbr> of un-vaccinated people. And despite the extra
        layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.

        So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread <abbr>COVID-19</abbr>
        to others?Infectious disease specialist <a href="">Lyssette Cardona,</a><abbr>MD,</abbr> answers those questions and covers why
        vaccination is still one of best weapons in the fight against <abbr>COVID-19</abbr>
